# vim configuration

This .vimrc requires `vim-plug`, https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug

When you have that installed (after following the instructions),
installation is only a matter of typing

```vim
:PlugInstall
```

Some of the plugins require further installation and compilation,
in particular YouCompleteMe and vim-go.

See the respective plugin pages for those packages and follow
the instructions there.
